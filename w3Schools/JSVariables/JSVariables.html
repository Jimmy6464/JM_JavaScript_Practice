  /*
    JavaScript variables
    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
    These unique names are called identifiers.

    The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
      Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
      Names must begin with a letter
      Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
      Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
      Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

    var x = 3;
    var y = 9;
    var z = x + y;
    var carName = "volvo";
    var carName;//If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = z;

    function changeVar() {
      z = x*2 + 9*y;
      x = "5" + 1 + 3;
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName+"x*2 + 9*y = "+ z + "x = "+x*2;//it  will be concatenated
    }
